   - **L1 (Basic)**: Simple issues that can be resolved with basic troubleshooting

     - Password resets, basic configuration changes
     - Common user errors with documented solutions
     - Simple UI/UX issues or cosmetic problems
     - Issues requiring minimal technical knowledge

   - **L2 (Intermediate)**: Technical issues requiring moderate expertise

     - Code debugging and API troubleshooting
     - Database queries and performance optimization
     - Integration problems between systems
     - Issues requiring specific technical skills

   - **L3 (Advanced)**: Complex issues requiring deep technical expertise
     - Architectural changes and system-wide modifications
     - Security analysis and vulnerability assessments
     - Custom development and complex integrations
     - Issues affecting multiple systems or requiring specialized knowledge

3. **Detailed Technical Guidance**:

   - Step-by-step troubleshooting procedures

### **Current Configuration (Development)**

The system is currently configured to use **Mailtrap** for email testing during development:

```env
# Mailtrap Configuration (Development/Testing)
MAILTRAP_SMTP_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PORT=2525
MAILTRAP_SMTP_USER=your_mailtrap_username
MAILTRAP_SMTP_PASS=your_mailtrap_password
```

**Note**: Mailtrap captures emails in a sandbox environment and does not send them to real email addresses. This is perfect for development and testing.

### **Production Email Configuration**

When deploying to production, companies should configure a real email service. Here are the recommended options:

#### **Option 1: Gmail SMTP (Recommended for Small-Medium Companies)**

**Setup Steps:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on the Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account Settings → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and generate a new app password
3. Update the email configuration in `utils/mail.js`:

```javascript
// Replace Mailtrap configuration with Gmail SMTP
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.GMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD, // Use App Password, not regular password
  },
});
```

4. Add to `.env` file:
```env
GMAIL_USER=company_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
```

#### **Option 2: SendGrid (Recommended for Large Companies)**

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create a SendGrid account
2. Generate an API key
3. Update email configuration:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: 'apikey',
    pass: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,
  },
});
```

4. Add to `.env` file:
```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

#### **Option 3: AWS SES (Enterprise Solution)**

**Setup Steps:**
1. Configure AWS SES in your AWS account
2. Verify email addresses or domains
3. Update email configuration:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: process.env.AWS_SES_HOST,
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.AWS_SES_USER,
    pass: process.env.AWS_SES_PASS,
  },
});
```

### **Production Email Best Practices**

- **Use App Passwords**: Never use regular passwords for SMTP authentication
- **Environment Variables**: Store all email credentials in environment variables
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement email rate limiting to avoid spam filters
- **Error Handling**: Log email failures and implement retry mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Set up email delivery monitoring and alerts

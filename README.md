## 🔧 AI Integration

### Gemini AI Analysis

The system uses Google's Gemini AI model to provide intelligent ticket analysis:

1. **Priority Assessment**:

   - HIGH: Critical issues affecting core functionality, security vulnerabilities, data loss
   - MEDIUM: Important features not working, performance issues, UI/UX problems
   - LOW: Minor bugs, cosmetic issues, enhancement requests

2. **Level Classification (L1, L2, L3)**:

   - **L1 (Basic)**: Simple issues that can be resolved with basic troubleshooting

     - Password resets, basic configuration changes
     - Common user errors with documented solutions
     - Simple UI/UX issues or cosmetic problems
     - Issues requiring minimal technical knowledge

   - **L2 (Intermediate)**: Technical issues requiring moderate expertise

     - Code debugging and API troubleshooting
     - Database queries and performance optimization
     - Integration problems between systems
     - Issues requiring specific technical skills

   - **L3 (Advanced)**: Complex issues requiring deep technical expertise
     - Architectural changes and system-wide modifications
     - Security analysis and vulnerability assessments
     - Custom development and complex integrations
     - Issues affecting multiple systems or requiring specialized knowledge

3. **Detailed Technical Guidance**:

   - Step-by-step troubleshooting procedures
   - Code examples and configuration changes
   - Debugging techniques and tools
   - Alternative approaches and workarounds
   - Environment-specific considerations

4. **Resource Recommendations**:
   - Official documentation links
